    "    - Purpose: \n",
    "        - Given X (features/independent variables) what is our best estimate of outcome Y (taregt/dependent variable)?\n",
    "    - Characteristic:\n",
    "        - Minimize some sort of expected prediction error (using in-sample prediction error on Y as an approximate)\n",
    "        - Care and evaluate out-of-sample performance (is there overfitting? is the prediction stable?)\n",
    "- **Causal Inference:**\n",
    "    - Purpose: \n",
    "        - What happens to Y (treatment effect) if we intervene to change some X while keeping other X unchanged?\n",
    "        - In other word, predicting (estimating) the treatment effect (TE)\n",
    "    - Characteristic:\n",
    "        - Impossible to minimize expected prediction error as the true TE is never observed\n",
    "        - As a result, need variations that isolates causal mechanism in order to identify the TE estimator\n",
    "            - For experimental data, such variatrion is guaranteed through random assignment of treatment\n",
    "            - For observational data, however, need variation achieved through quasi-experiment and assumptions\n",
    "        - Care out-of-sample performance (is the TE estimator stable?) but cannot evaluate"

    "- Advantage of Machine learning (non-parametric methods) relative to parametric methods:\n",
    "    - ML concentrated on developing computationally efficient predictive algorithms\n",
    "    - It leverages the bias–variance trade-off in order to achieve high predictive accuracy\n",
    "    - Through introudcing regularization, many ML methods drop some variables to reduce variance of the estimators\n",
    "    - This imporves out-of-sample stability of the estimator (and prediction) while increasing bias (the estimator is no longer correct in average)"
